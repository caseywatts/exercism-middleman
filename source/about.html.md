# About

Exercism began as a way to support students learning to code by giving them practice problems and real world feedback.

In a way, the entire site happened by accident as Exercism spread by word of mouth, whereby current users helped new users get started. If you happened to come to the site without the support of someone more experienced, it was very difficult to get started.

Weâ€™re so happy to have you here! ^_^_

If you having trouble getting started, we'd love to help!
