    The feedback system of `exercism.io` ("Nitpicker" = Dashboard, Current Exercises, Teams) feels like it should be separate from the main informational site (What is Exercism, How to get set up). This might help if there's a [global navbar](https://github.com/exercism/website/issues/20) controlling the different pages?
