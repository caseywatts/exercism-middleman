To get your programming environment set up for this environment see LINKTODOCS.

Do multiple iterations until you're satisfied

## 4. Code Review
This is done on the exercism.io website.

Once you've submitted a working copy of your code you're satisfied with, check out others' code. Please do X number of reviews. If you like things, say so! Especially if something inspires you to change something in your code. If you can give critical feedback do that etc etc.
